Used assets folder to store images, strings and fonts.
Added a config file to manage the main options of the app from there.
Chosen theme of the game and added card images.
Added views and functionalities.

Converted from Class components to Functional components to avoid incompatibilities wit react-route-dom v6.
Audited vulnerabilities of project with "npm audit fix --force"

Didn't use third party libraries to do it with own code.
