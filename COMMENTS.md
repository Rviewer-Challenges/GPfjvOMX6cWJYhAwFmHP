First added a clean React project.
Used React Class Components, and separated components in each folder.
Added prettier conf.
Used assets folder to store images, strings and fonts.
Added a config file to manage the main options of the app from there.
Chosen theme of the game and added card images.
Added views and functionalities.
Didn't use third party libraries to do it with own code.
Added card animation.
Converted from Class components to Functional components to avoid incompatibilities wit react-route-dom v6.
Added redux.
Added some samples tests.
Project cleaned and added correspondant page title, favicon, etc.
Audited vulnerabilities of project with "npm audit fix --force"

TODO:
-read card images names from folder directly, to be able to add new cards only by adding them to the folder.
-Improve css code.
-Add more tests.
